    <h4>Introduction to HTML</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>I learnt about the basics of HTML. We fot a basic understanding of the structure of a web page, and how we put data onto a webpage. We learnt how to create coding that would result in getting data onto a webpage, and understanding the strcutre of a webpage. It was a fascinating lesson, and Alex's enthusisam and knowlkedge around the subject makes for a really interesting subject to learn</p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>Alex gave us a clear step by step guide, showing us how to create our own Google Home Page clone. We are at the very early stages of creating the page, and we uploaded the skeleton of the page.</p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>Having lost my internet connection halfway through the session, I was a little concerned about catching up later on. I came back to the lesson once it had finished, and at first I struggled to grasp which tool I needed for which part of the lesson. However, once I got on top of the issue, through the clear step by step guide from Alex, I thoroughly enjoyed the session, and seeing the end product was very satisfying.</p>

    <h4>Introduction to CSS</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>I learnt about what CSS does, how it works, the rules of CSS and the properties and values within CSS coding. We also learnt about colours and thier values. Text formatting, selectors, box model and finally positioning. I found the box modelling aspect of this session very interesting. Again, through Alex's excellent knowledge and enthusiasm for the subject, the topics covered are explained in such good detail. It makes for a very enjoyable session.</p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>We started off by going over previous sessions work. Understanding how the different layers of coding effect each other. So for this session we are into the second layer of a web page. CSS. The presentation and layout of a webpage. By the end of the session we had changed background colours of our webpage, changed Text Formatting too.</p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>I really enjoyed this session, and only really struggled with uderstanding how to push our code onto the live page. ONce Alex had explained this, the rest was fun and rewarding.</p>

    <h4>Introduction to CSS part 2</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>Today we learned about FlexBox, how it works, how to use it and its benefits We also more about CSS in general. Topics covered were the layout of a webpage and how to deal with different sized screens.</p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>We didn;t put into practice how to deal with different size screens, but Alex gave some great demonstations as to what might be expecetd to do in the field. By the end of the session we were able to rearrange the layout of our clone page into a much more visually pleasing order.</p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>I really enjoyed this session, there's a lot of info on flex to take on, but with some more practice outside of the session, and also due to Alex's excellent session, I feel I can get to grips with this. Really interesting and rewarding session again.</p>

    <h4>Introduction to CSS part 3</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>Today we learned more advanced techniques within FlexBox. We were frist shown how to do the old technique, Floating. Having seen the two techniques, you can see the advantages of FlexBox. We were given several tasks today, which were apart of desinging a webpage that eventaully will have images and filters included.</p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>Alex would take us through a step by step process, with great demonstrations throughout. Each phase of the session would follow a similar pattern, allowing us to learn the theory and also get to grips with the practical side of creating a webpage. </p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>Having not been able to attend the sessions live due to work, the clear and concise lessons from Alex have allowed me to really take my time with each area covered. Really enjoying this course, and looking forward to more sessions</p>

  <h4>Introduction to JavaScript</h4>
  <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
  <p>Todays lesson was an introduction to JavaScript. Lots of theory on the subject, and it was a really intersting insight into a new topic on the course.</p>
  <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
  <p>We were tasked with connecting our JavaScript to the HTML. A fun task, and we could see the end product on the live server. We were also tasked with inserting multiple line comments, and adding five variables to our coding. The variables were all to do with a tin of beans.</p>
  <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
  <p>There was a lot of information to take on baord this session. Some areas I will have to go over again just tk make sure it all goes in. Still enjoyable and very interesting</p>

  <h4>Functions and Control Flow</h4>
  <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
  <p>In todays session we covered the following topics. Functions, what are they, creating them and using them. Returning a value, using the return keyword. Arrow functions, updating our functions to ESS. Scope, Local v Global. Control Flow, adding logic to our JavaScript.</p>
  <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
  <p>The tasks today were to create functions for several different variables. We were shown coding that would create these functions on Visual Studio Code.</p>
  <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
  <p>Similar to the last session, with a lot of theory to digest. It's taking a litle longer for some of the rules to sink in, but I'm managing to work it out by going at my own pace. Enjoying the sessions, and looking forward to the next one</p>

  <h4>JavaScript practicals pt1</h4>
  <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
  <p>Really enjoyable session today. Two very detailed practical tasks, mixed in with a good amount of theory. By the end of the session we had developed our coding with more work on functions, validating the code, and understanding more detailed code.</p>
  <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h>
  <p>We were able to create code that would allow us to create orders with code. We were also shown how to make sure the correct code was in place for correct and incorrect orders.</p>
  <h5>What did I find hard?</h5> 
  <p>I found the last task difficult in areas, I wasn't able to figure out why my code wasn't working for the calculator. After some back and forth, I eventually figured it out, and the task was complete.</p>

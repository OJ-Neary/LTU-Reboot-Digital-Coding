    <h4>Introduction to HTML</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>I learnt about the basics of HTML. We fot a basic understanding of the structure of a web page, and how we put data onto a webpage. We learnt how to create coding that would result in getting data onto a webpage, and understanding the strcutre of a webpage. It was a fascinating lesson, and Alex's enthusisam and knowlkedge around the subject makes for a really interesting subject to learn</p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>Alex gave us a clear step by step guide, showing us how to create our own Google Home Page clone. We are at the very early stages of creating the page, and we uploaded the skeleton of the page.</p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>Having lost my internet connection halfway through the session, I was a little concerned about catching up later on. I came back to the lesson once it had finished, and at first I struggled to grasp which tool I needed for which part of the lesson. However, once I got on top of the issue, through the clear step by step guide from Alex, I thoroughly enjoyed the session, and seeing the end product was very satisfying.</p>

    <h4>Introduction to CSS</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>I learnt about what CSS does, how it works, the rules of CSS and the properties and values within CSS coding. We also learnt about colours and thier values. Text formatting, selectors, box model and finally positioning. I found the box modelling aspect of this session very interesting. Again, through Alex's excellent knowledge and enthusiasm for the subject, the topics covered are explained in such good detail. It makes for a very enjoyable session.</p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>We started off by going over previous sessions work. Understanding how the different layers of coding effect each other. So for this session we are into the second layer of a web page. CSS. The presentation and layout of a webpage. By the end of the session we had changed background colours of our webpage, changed Text Formatting too.</p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>I really enjoyed this session, and only really struggled with uderstanding how to push our code onto the live page. ONce Alex had explained this, the rest was fun and rewarding.</p>

    <h4>Introduction to CSS part 2</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>Today we learned about FlexBox, how it works, how to use it and its benefits We also more about CSS in general. Topics covered were the layout of a webpage and how to deal with different sized screens.</p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>We didn;t put into practice how to deal with different size screens, but Alex gave some great demonstations as to what might be expecetd to do in the field. By the end of the session we were able to rearrange the layout of our clone page into a much more visually pleasing order.</p>
    <h5>What did I find hard?</h5>
    <p>I really enjoyed this session, there's a lot of info on flex to take on, but with some more practice outside of the session, and also due to Alex's excellent session, I feel I can get to grips with this. Really interesting and rewarding session again.</p>
